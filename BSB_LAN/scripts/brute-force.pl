# This script calls BSB-LAN and queries all possible combinations within one
# major command area (defined in the fist byte of $baseID. The second byte
# seems to be static or irrelevant and is mostly used as 3D which is why it is
# hardcoded here.
# To query other major command areas, change the 0x05... in $baseID to 
# 0x2D (HK1), 0x31 (TWW) or others and report the results back to us.
# Following major IDs are know to exist, but there may be more in rather
# special settings: 05, 06, 07, 09, 0D, 11, 15, 19, 21, 22, 25, 29, 2A, 2B, 2D,
# 2E, 2F, 31, 49, 51, 59, 65, 69
# Check in BSB_LAN_defs.h first if a major group does apply to your heater
# before running tests. Some of them are specific to certain features (such
# as solar or cooling), so it won't make sense for you to test this group.
# 
# Log output will be appended to defs-brute-force-<Heater-ID>.h
# Please note that BSB_LAN_defs.h has to be in the same folder as this script.
# Testing one major category will take approx. 18 hours, more if you increase
# the delay between queries via the sleep command (now at 1/4 second).

# Set $URL to point to your BSB-LAN installation, including (optional) passkey.
# Note: No trailing slash!
