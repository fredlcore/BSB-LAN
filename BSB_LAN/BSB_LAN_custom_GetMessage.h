// Add custom code for handling broadcast and other incoming messages here which will be included in the loop() function 
// after the GetMessage() function call. If msg[0] is zero, no valid message has been received. Otherwise, you can process the 
// received message as you like. See custom_functions/Monitor_error_broadcasts/BSB_LAN_custom_GetMessage.h for an example implementation.
